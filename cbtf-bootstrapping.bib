abstract = {To address the challenges of running exams in large enrollment CS courses, we set up and operated an in-person testing center at a minority serving institution. We have run the testing center for two quarters, proctoring over 6,000 exams for eight CS courses with approximately 1,800 students. In this experience report, we discuss the motivation for the testing center, its set-up and operation, and the lessons that we have learned from our first two quarters of operation. In addition, we present student and instructor feedback regarding use of the testing center, future steps, and improvements.By sharing, we hope that other schools can learn from our experience and improve upon our methods to help establish best practices for testing center configuration and operation.},

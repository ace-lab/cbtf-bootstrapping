\section{IT Involvement}

\textbf{Lesson:} Minimize the interface with campus IT to minimize the
overall number of moving parts

\subsection{Software: PrairieLearn}

Use hosted PL. Univ IT staff are not optimized for this sort of thing. It's open source, but labor cost of ops is real, plus having to manually scale EC2 up and down.


Also, reservaitons MUCH simpler (esp. accommodations) if you can use PT.


Caveat: external grading costs >2x the price of not


No: lockdown browser, etc

\subsection{Hardware}


We've used ~15yo computers currently running Windows 11. Really all
you need is a browser, so demands are minimal.

Do: Use IP firewalling or CIDR-level firewalling 

Don’t: lockdown browser, etc.

Ensure USB ports are disabled

Don't rely on wifi

Caveat: ensure systems needed for campus login, 2FA work properly

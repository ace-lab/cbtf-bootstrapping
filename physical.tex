\section{Physical Configuration}

\subsection{Privacy}

We purchased anti-glare/privacy screens for about \$30 per
workstation\footnote{\url{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9L8NQLW}} that
can be affixed to monitors using Velcro, since we could not make
permanent changes to the shared computers.
When it was the CBTF's turn to use the labs, we would arrange for our
reservation to begin (and proctors to arrive) 30 minutes before the
first reservable exam shift to put the screens on,  then stay 30 min
late to take them off.
This implies the CBTF also needs a place where this and related
supplies can be stored.
In our case, the other supplies included a few pairs of
noise-cancelling headphones, and packs of scratch paper color-coded
for different sessions.

We also purchased inexpensive desk
dividers\footnote{\url{https://www.amazon.com/Dividers-Students-Waterproof-Classroom-Supplies/dp/B0F3CVPDYC}}
both to further thwart cheating and provide some visual blocking for
Reduced Distraction accommodations (see Section~\ref{sec:a11y}).

You will want a way for students to leave personal belongings (smart
watches, phones, etc.) clearly away from testing stations.  Our shared
labs didn't have any good place for this, so we had students leave
their belongings under the desk; but it's harder to spot them
fidgeting with things.  Similarly, beware of items in bulky jacket
pockets when jackets aren't removed, baggy sweaters, and so on.

A major caveat to ``no devices'' is two-factor authentication; see Section~\ref{sec:networking}.


\subsection{Equipment and Facility Maintenance}

The shared labs we used are centrally administered, cleaned, hardware
maintained, and so on.  Therefore there were
well-posted and well-exercised methods for notifying the maintainers
of equipment failures.
We did, however,
need to coordinate physical access, since the labs are only open to
students when they are staffed by a particular user holding the
reservation.  Usually the user is a specific instructor or academic
staff member who has reserved the lab for a particular course; in our
case, we had a rotating staff of TAs (proctors) who needed access, so
we had to work out a system by which they could obtain and return the
physical keys before and after each exam shift.  (Many spaces on our
campus are controlled by cardkey access that can be enabled for
particular students' ID cards, but these labs had physical keys.)

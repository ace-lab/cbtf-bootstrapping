\section{Physical Configuration}

\subsection{Privacy}

Get privacy screens. <\$40/host on Amazon. Can be velcroed so you
don't make permanent changes to shared machines. We had proctors show
up ~30 min before first "shift" to put the screens up, then stay 30
min late to take them off

Get partitions for reduced distraction (or general privacy)


Have a way for students to leave personal belongings (incl. watches, phones, etc) clearly away from testing station. On ground is OK but harder to spot. Beware of in jacket pockets/baggy sweaters, etc.  Best is apply same rule to all: no personal devices near you, period. CAVEAT: 2FA.


\subsection{Accessibility}


XT should be “easy” to handle


Can any stations be setup for RD? Work with your campus DSP to do this, or else punt on it. Don’t assume you know what RD means
